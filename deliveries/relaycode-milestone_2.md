# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/relaycode.md
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context**

Milestone 2 builds on the MVP extrinsic builder from M1 by adding wallet integration, comprehensive input validation, 21 specialized type-aware input components, 1:1 hex pane decomposition, and production-quality UI refinements. The application now supports the full lifecycle of extrinsic building — from selecting a pallet and method, to filling typed parameter fields with real-time validation, to signing and submitting transactions via wallet extensions. The codebase has been upgraded to use LunoKit for wallet connectivity and Dedot v1 for type-safe chain interactions.

**Additional Information**

> The M2 milestone significantly expanded the extrinsic builder from the M1 foundation. Key highlights:
>
> - **21 specialized input components** covering all major Substrate types (Account, Balance, Amount, Boolean, Hash, Bytes, Vec, BTreeMap, BTreeSet, Option, Enum, Struct, Tuple, Call, Vote, VoteThreshold, Moment, KeyValue, VectorFixed, and Text as fallback)
> - **LunoKit wallet integration** supporting all major Polkadot wallet extensions with multi-chain switching
> - **1:1 hex pane mirroring** that decomposes encoded call data into a tree matching the form structure, showing per-field hex with real-time updates
> - **Bi-directional editing** — paste hex-encoded extrinsic data to decode back into form fields
> - **174 automated tests** ensuring reliability of the type resolution, codec, validation, and hook layers

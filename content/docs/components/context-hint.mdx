# ContextHint

ContextHint is a small utility component that renders an inline hint below a form input. It displays a text message with an icon (defaulting to an Info icon) in a muted, compact style. It is used by contextual selectors and the Era Selector to surface live chain data as helpful context for the user.

## When It Appears

ContextHint is not a standalone selector -- it is a building block used internally by other selector components. It appears:

- Inside `EraSelector` to show current and active era values.
- Inside `SelectorFallback` to indicate that context data is unavailable.
- Can be used in any custom selector to display contextual information.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text` | `string` | Yes | The hint text to display |
| `icon` | `React.ReactNode` | No | Custom icon element. Defaults to a Lucide `Info` icon (14px) |

## Features

- **Compact layout**: Renders as a flex row with a small icon and text in `text-xs text-muted-foreground` styling.
- **Customizable icon**: Accepts any React node as the icon. Defaults to the Lucide `Info` icon at 12x12px.
- **Non-intrusive**: Styled to appear as secondary information below the main input without drawing focus.

## Data Source

ContextHint does not fetch any data itself. It receives pre-formatted text from its parent component.

## Usage

```tsx
import { ContextHint } from "@/components/params/selectors/context-hint";

// Default Info icon
<ContextHint text="Current era: 1234 . Active era: 1233" />

// Custom icon
import { AlertCircle } from "lucide-react";
<ContextHint
  text="Context unavailable -- enter value manually"
  icon={<AlertCircle className="h-3 w-3 shrink-0 text-amber-500" />}
/>
```

## Value Format

ContextHint does not emit any value. It is a display-only component.

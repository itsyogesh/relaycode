Learn how to connect your wallet, select a chain, and build your first extrinsic using Relaycode's dual-pane builder interface.

### [Guide](/docs/guide)

Understand the architecture, design patterns, and internal systems that power Relaycode, including the three-layer architecture and input component registry.

### [API Reference](/docs/api)

Detailed reference for Relaycode's core modules: the input map type resolution system, SCALE codec encoding/decoding, and form validation utilities.

### [Components](/docs/components)

Documentation for Relaycode's UI components, including the specialized input components for Substrate types like accounts, balances, vectors, and more.
